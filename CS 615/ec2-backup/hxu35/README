please run make install

> Why you choose the programming language
I used Bash in version 1, so just continue.

> The approach you took
I used a package called jq to parse the json output and it worked well, which saved me a lot of time. 
Also, I learnt how to use scp and the environment variable from ec2-backup-prep.sh.

> Any considerations
The version of openssl used in NetBSD Python 3.7 is still 1.0.1, which caused a lot of warning.

Is there a better way to wait for the instance to complete initialization instead of "sleep 34"?

> Misc
Good coding habit and time management really matters.

> What changed in this version

- Makefile will install bash while running "make install"

- The program will detect if the environment variables are already set at the beginning

- The ssh will find the key file because I changed ~/.ssh to /root/.ssh

- Sometimes the program need to sleep 300 seconds before the instance is ready 

- A lot of bugs fixed

- The program will write backup files to the raw disk now. Thanks a lot for the hints provided by professor.

- But the Openssl version warning exists even after I manually updated openssl to 1.0.2 and "openssl version -a" showed 1.0.2, maybe the problem of NetBSD system itself?
